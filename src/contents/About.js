                    I came to Canada to pursue my Computer Science Bachalor Degree in 2015, at Carleton
                    University in Ottawa. At the begining,  I find programming concepts were hard to grasp as it requires
                    different way of thinking compares to what I'm used to. I started my first programming course with absolute zero
                    knowledge in programming. Quite frankly, I've been through a lot of debate and doubting myself if I made the right choice
                    to pursue a degree in CS. However, with persistant and patient,
                    I became better and better in programming and developed a huge interest in this field.
                    I have learned that a successful programmer is not just about writing solid code or being expert
                    at different languages, but the way a programmer thinks and approaches a problem is far more critical.

                    As the world of teachnology keeps revolving, I took every opportunities to attend tech related
                    conferences and hackathons to learn from other professionals and broaden my knowledge. I'm amazed
                    at the positive impact of technology in our everyday life and how coding influence the world.
                    I look up to the innovators and hoping to be one of them who create a better future for humankind.
                    Having the thoughts of being able to contribute to the society with the knowledge I acquired
                    throughout my life have kept me motivated to be better than who I am today.
