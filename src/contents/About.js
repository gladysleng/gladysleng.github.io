                    I came to Canada to pursue my Computer Science degreee in 2015, at Carleton
                    University in Ottawa. I started my first programming course with absolute zero
                    knowledge in programming. At the begining of my journey in learning about the world
                    of computer science, I find programming concepts were hard to grasp as it requires
                    an different way of thinking compares to other subjects. However, with persistant and patient,
                    I became better and better in programming and developed a huge interest in this field.
                    I have learned that a successful programmer is not about how clean the code is or being expert
                    at different languages, but the way the programmer thinks and approaches a problem is far more critical.

                    As the world of teachnology keeps revolving, I took every opportunities to attend tech related
                    conferences and hackathons to learn from other professionals and broaden my knowledge.I'm amazed
                    at the positive impact of technology in our everyday life and how coding influence the world.
                    I look up to the innovators and hoping to be one of them who create a better future for humankind.
                    Having the thoughts of being able to contribute to the society with the knowledge I acquired
                    throughout my life have kept me motivated to be better than who I am today.
